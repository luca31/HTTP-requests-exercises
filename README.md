# HTTP requests exercises

## Installation and use

To host the api that allows you to perform the exercises you need to follow the following steps:
 - Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in LTS version
 - Download the [zip](https://github.com/luca31/HTTP-requests-exercises/zipball/master)
 - Open the directory extracted from the zip using the terminal: `cd your/directory/path`
 - Write the command `npm start`

Once you have completed all the steps, open your browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and start verifying your abilities. In this page you can also find an example python file containing the solution of the first exercise.

Note that once the hosting has been activated it will be necessary to open a new terminal page in case you want to execute further commands.


## Modifications of exercises and languages

To add or remove other exercises, simply modify the list of exercises in the `data/ex.json` file. If you want to contribute to the improvement of translations, you can proceed with the editing of the `data/languages.json` file and make a pull request.
