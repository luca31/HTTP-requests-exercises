# HTTP requests exercises

## Installation and use

To host the api that allows you to perform the exercises you need to follow the following steps:
 - Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) in LTS version
 - Download the [zip](https://github.com/luca31/HTTP-requests-exercises/zipball/master)
 - Open the directory extracted from the zip using the terminal: `cd your/directory/path`
 - Write the command `npm start`

Once you have completed all the steps, open the browser on page [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) or [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for instructions. There is also an example python file containing the solution of the first exercise. To terminate the server, press the `CTRL / control` + `C` key combination on the terminal page.

Note that once the hosting has been activated it will be necessary to open a new terminal page in case you want to execute further commands.


## Modifications of exercises and languages

To add or remove other exercises, simply modify the list of exercises in the `ex.json` file. If you want to contribute to the improvement of translations, you can proceed with the modification of the `languages.json` file.
